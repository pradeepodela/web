                    <h3>Service Delivery</h3>
                    <p>Certain services offered, focus on bringing the attention of real users to your Instagram profile with goals that may include increasing followers, likes, and comments. The expected amount of followers, likes and comments is not guaranteed to you in any way. Regardless of any perceived representation to the contrary, Nitreo in no way guarantees a specific result for Customers. You understand that you are paying us for our effort to generate results, but that results are never guaranteed as there are many factors involved, some of which are out of our control. Moreover, we cannot protect you from spam, fake, or inactive followers, as it is not always possible to avoid them. It is understood that Nitreo has no control over Instagram and if they decide to make changes to their platform.</p>

                    </div>
                    <h3>The Customer Agrees To Limitation of Liability</h3>
                    <p>The Company may not be held liable for any potential damages incurred. In no event will you or us have any liability to the other for lost profit, revenue, or any circumstantial, incidental, consequential, punitive, or other forms of damages however they may have been caused, whether in contract, or under any other theoretical circumstance of liability and regardless of whether the party has been advised of the possibility of the aforementioned damages. You will have no financial liability to us for a breach of these Terms, and our maximum aggregate liability to you for any alleged breach of these Terms is ONE HUNDRED US DOLLARS (100 USD).</p>
                    <h3>The Customer Agrees To The Refund Policy as Described</h3>
                    <p>Refunds are not provided if the Service is provided as stated, and the Customer account displays positive growth due to the Service. Please be advised growth is relative, and while Nitreo will strive to provide the best results, these may vary depending on account quality, content, niche etc. A certain amount of followers, comments or any other form of growth is not guaranteed.</p>
                    <p>Our refund policy lasts 30 days from the date of your initial purchase. After 30 days of service, we do not offer any refunds. When you register with Nitreo, you agree to pay and take responsibility for all charges made in accordance with your plan and these policies. In order to be fair to all clients, no exceptions are made.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold my-5 py-3 px-3 alert alert-primary border-none">Refund requests are reviewed on a case by case basis. The refund policy as described in the Terms of Service does not serve as a guarantee of refund.</p>
                    <h3 class="h2">Refunds (if applicable)</h3>
                    <p>If your refund is approved and within the terms of our policy then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment within 3-10 business days.</p>
                    <p>Refunds for annual and semi-annual subscriptions are provided at the sole discretion of the Company, only within the first 30 days of purchase. Should a refund for an annual subscription be provided at the discretion of the Company, the Company may offer only partial refund in accordance to the remaining time on the Subscription minus discount offered on the price.</p>
                    <h3>Refunds when loss of access to service</h3>
                    <p>Refunds for any subscription type due to loss of access to a service related to Instagram will be honored at the sole discretion of the Company. This may include loss of access to an account and loss of access to features within a social media app, in example features related to Instagram Shopping.</p>
                    <h3>Refunds when account paused</h3>
                    <p>As stated in the Customer Dashboard and Terms of Service, pausing an account does not cancel the subscription and related charges. The pause functionality serves to let your account manager know he should temporarily stop activity on your account. It does not pause the subscription itself, meaning it does not affect time until the subscription is renewed or the billing date. We don’t currently credit additional days for paused days. If you believe you should be credited with days for a paused account please contact Support.</p>
                    <h3>Refunds due to performance issues</h3>
                    <p>Refund requests based on performance issues are reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and only during 30 days from initial purchase. Requests may include but are not limited to slow growth or irrelevant quality of followers and/or likes. While the Company strives to render Services as best as possible, the Company is under no obligation to fulfil requests of refunds.</p>
                    <h3>Refunds due to recurring subscription billing agreement</h3>
                    <p>Should a refund request be submitted by the Customer due to the Customer not being aware of a recurring subscription, the Company is able to fulfil said requests at its sole discretion. Generally, it is the responsibility of the Customer to understand the nature of their Billing Agreement, which is expressly mentioned on the Pricing section of the Website, as well as during the checkout process of the Company's designated payment provider.</p>
                    <h3>Refunds due to unexpected service</h3>
                    <p>Should the customer request a refund on the basis that the service is not as expected, the Company is able to fulfil such refund requests at its sole discretion and only within 30 days of initial purchase. The Company is under no obligation to fulfil refund requests in the event the Customer claims service is not as expected.</p>
                    <h3>Refunds due to untimely cancellation</h3>
                    <p>Should the Customer cancel the Billing Agreement with the Company in an untimely fashion, the Company is able to fulfil said refund request at its sole discretion. In most instances, the Customer is offered Services for the rest of the paid month. Should an untimely cancellation occur within a reasonable timeframe as determined by the Company, the Customer may be eligible for a refund.</p>
                    <h3>Refunds due to Inactivity</h3>
                    <p>Should the Customer request a refund due to account inactivity as caused by technical issues. the Company may issue a refund at its sole discretion. Refunds in such instances are typically fulfilled when the issue cannot be solved within a reasonable timeframe as determined by the Company. As such, refund requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                    <h3>Refunds due to Double Charge</h3>
                    <p>Should the Customer enter an additional billing agreement with the Company that renders the first billing agreement obsolete, the Customer may be double-charged by mistake. In such instances, the Company shall always endeavor to refund the Customer in a reasonable timeframe as determined by the Company.</p>
                    <p class="alert alert-primary border-none px-5 py-5">
                    If you believe you should be issued a refund, please reach out to our support team with full details of your request. While we strive to be as fair as possible when reviewing a refund request, please keep in mind that refunds are usually provided only in extreme circumstances.</p>
                    <h3 class="h2">Discrepancies & Terms Acceptance</h3>
